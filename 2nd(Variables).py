# Variables are like boxes where we store data

"""Rules:
  . We can not start variable name with a number (1name = "Ram" is incorrect) 
     and a symbol (#name = "Ram" is incorrect) in symbol we only use '_' (_name = "Ram" is correct),
     we also use numbers but after one charecter (n1name = "Ram" is correct)
  . We could not gave any gap in variable name (na me = "Ram" is incorrect)"""


''' We use # for sigle line comment
    We use """ """ or ''' ''' for multiline comment'''
